                Hi, I’m Edmarc Dave, a second-year Information Technology student at the University of the Cordilleras. I specialize in Web Technology and have a passion for creating user-friendly websites.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree and have learned various web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java and Python. I also have experience with graphic design tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve worked on several exciting projects. I created a webpage dedicated to food recipes, demonstrating my ability to design user-friendly interfaces. I’ve also utilized JavaScript for dynamic web content. Additionally, I developed a text-based game in Python, which showcases my problem-solving skills and creativity. In our Technopreneurship course, I worked on a website using WordPress, gaining valuable experience in content management systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                My career aspirations lie in the fields of front-end development, UI design, and graphic design. I aim to create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces that enhance user experience and engagement.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy reading BL Manhuas, practicing self-portrait and macro photography, learning new languages like Thai and Spanish, playing chess, swimming, and gardening.
